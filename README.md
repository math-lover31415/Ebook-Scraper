# Ebook-Scrapper
<p>A web scrapper that will go through the works of Wildbow and save themas epub</p>
<p>The program goes through chapets one by one and iterates through the paragraphs to create a chapter and then add it to an epub object that is saved after the program runs its course</p>
<p>The program takes quite a while to run, and it might be worked on in the future once I have more of an idea what to do.</p>
<p>The program is intended to be expanded upon to give an otiopn to download any of wildbow's works</p>
